      <title>Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apache Log4j2 &amp;lt;=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Log4Shell (CVE-2021-45046)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allow attackers to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Out of Band XSS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is an attack technique that involves echoing attacker-supplied code into a user&amp;rsquo;s browser instance. A browser instance can be a standard web browser client, or a browser object embedded in a software product such as the browser within WinAmp, an RSS reader, or an email client. The code itself is usually written in HTML/JavaScript, but may also extend to VBScript, ActiveX, Java, Flash, or any other browser-supported technology.&#xA;When an attacker gets a user&amp;rsquo;s browser to execute his/her code, the code will run within the security context (or zone) of the hosting web site. With this level of privilege, the code has the ability to read, modify and transmit any sensitive data accessible by the browser. A Cross-site Scripted user could have his/her account hijacked (cookie theft), their browser redirected to another location, or possibly shown fraudulent content delivered by the web site they are visiting. Cross-site Scripting attacks essentially compromise the trust relationship between a user and the web site. Applications utilizing browser object instances which load content from the file system may execute code under the local machine zone allowing for system compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web server receives a remote address and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apache Commons Text prior to 1.10.0 allows RCE when applied to untrusted input due to insecure interpolation defaults.Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded.The application has been shown to initial contact with remote servers via variable interpolation and may well be vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
