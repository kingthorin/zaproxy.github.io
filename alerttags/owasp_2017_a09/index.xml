      <description>The TLS implementation in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g does not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, potentially disclosing sensitive information.</description>

      <description>The server initiated a proxied request via the proxy specified in the HTTP Proxy header of the request.Httpoxy typically affects code running in CGI or CGI like environments. This may allow attackers to:
Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing or Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy </description>

      <description>Apache Log4j2 &amp;lt;=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.</description>

      <description>It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allow attackers to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments.</description>

      <description>Improper input handling is one of the most common weaknesses identified across applications today. Poorly handled input is a leading cause behind critical vulnerabilities that exist in systems and applications.
Generally, the term input handing is used to describe functions like validation, sanitization, filtering, encoding and/or decoding of input data.</description>

      <description>Apache Commons Text prior to 1.10.0 allows RCE when applied to untrusted input due to insecure interpolation defaults.Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded.The application has been shown to initial contact with remote servers via variable interpolation and may well be vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE).</description>
