      <description>A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.</description>

      <title>GraphQL Endpoint Supports Introspection</title>

      <description>The GraphQL endpoint has Introspection enabled. Introspection allows clients to query the schema and retrieve detailed information about the fields, types, inputs, etc. supported by the GraphQL endpoint. This may be valuable to an attacker, as it could enable them to craft more targeted queries.</description>
