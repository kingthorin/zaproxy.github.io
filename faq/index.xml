      <description>You have 3 options:
Convince one of the existing ZAP developers that they should implement it Convince someone else to implement it for you Implement it yourself Some of the ZAP core developers are paid to work on ZAP. If you can convince one of the us that we should implement it asap then this will probably be the quickest option as obviously we know the code base well.</description>

      <guid>/faq/why-dont-you-rewrite-zap-in-my-favorite-language/</guid>
      <description>OK, so this question doesn&amp;rsquo;t get asked all the time, but it does come up every so often.
So here&amp;rsquo;s the official response:
Firstly, do you really need ZAP rewritten?
ZAP supports all of the JSR 223 scripting languages, so you can already extend ZAP in a very wide range of scripting languages, including JavaScript, Jython, and Jruby.</description>

      <guid>/faq/why-is-zap-not-available-in-my-language/</guid>
      <description>We rely on people like yourself to translate ZAP into other languages.
If your language is not available then it means that we, the developers, unfortunately don&amp;rsquo;t speak your language well enough to translate it and no one else has volunteered.
However you can help :)
Get in touch with us if you want to translate ZAP into another language, we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you!</description>

      <title>How can I add my own payloads to active scan rules?</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/faq/how-can-i-add-my-own-payloads-to-active-scan-rules/</guid>
      <description>ZAP doesn&amp;rsquo;t just throw a load of payloads at a target to see what happens :)
The payloads are targeted based on the responses to other payloads so that it hopefully zeros in on specific vulnerabilities.
However there a various options:
Try out the custom payloads add-on which is supported by some of the existing rules Change the existing rules to improve them - this blog post is a good place to start: Hacking ZAP: Active Scan Rules - if you do improve them then please submit pull requests :) Write new rules to do whatever you want - this gives you full control, but could be a bit daunting to start with Tweak the User defined attacks.</description>

      <title>How can I prevent ZAP from sending me 1000s of emails via a &#39;Contact Us&#39; form?</title>

      <guid>/faq/how-can-i-prevent-zap-from-sending-me-1000s-of-emails-via-a-contact-us-form/</guid>
      <description>In this case prevention is definitely better than cure.
By default when you use the ZAP spider and active scanner then ZAP will access all of the URLs, forms, and functionality it can find. If one of those results in your application sending emails then someone is going to get a LOT of emails.</description>

      <title>How do I handle a False Positive?</title>

      <guid>/faq/how-do-i-handle-a-false-positive/</guid>
      <description>False positives are where ZAP raises alerts for things that are not really vulnerabilities. You should make sure that you understand the potential vulnerability being reported and manually test it before concluding that it is not a real vulnerability.
Please report any false positives that you identify supplying as much information as you can, while obfuscating any sensitive information.</description>

      <title>How do I report a False Negative?</title>

      <guid>/faq/how-do-i-report-a-false-negative/</guid>
      <description>False Negatives are where ZAP fails to identify an issue when it should.
Reporting these problems to us for passive scan rules is straightforward - just let us know the full request and/or response that ZAP should have raised the problem for.
Reporting problems with active scan rules is a bit more tricky, as ZAP will potentially send several requests to detect a specific problem and we need to know how your application responded to each one.</description>

      <title>How often are scan rules updated?</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/faq/how-often-are-scan-rules-updated/</guid>
      <description>Scan rules are defined in add-ons so they can be updated and published whenever they are improved.
However this may be less frequently than you might expect, and there are good reasons for that.
Some security tools focus on finding known vulnerabilities in known applications. New vulnerabilities are being found all of the time so the rules for these tools need to be frequently updated.</description>

      <title>Is there any danger when scanning with ZAP against a live website (e.g. create/delete/update/corrupt data)?</title>
      <link>/faq/is-there-any-danger-when-scanning-with-zap-against-a-live-website-e-g-create-delete-update-corrupt-data/</link>

      <guid>/faq/is-there-any-danger-when-scanning-with-zap-against-a-live-website-e-g-create-delete-update-corrupt-data/</guid>
      <description>Proxying (and therefore passive scanning) requests via ZAP is completely safe and legal, it just allows you to see whats going on.
Spidering is a bit more dangerous. It could cause problems depending on how your application works.
Note that there is an Spider option to not use POST requests - this may be safer but is also likely to reduce the effectiveness of the Spider.</description>

      <guid>/faq/someone-is-using-zap-to-attack-my-website-what-should-i-do/</guid>
      <description>ZAP is a free tool designed to help everyone secure their own websites. Unfortunately this means that other people can use it to attack your website as well.
ZAP is not designed to be a covert tool - it uses various variations of &amp;ldquo;ZAP&amp;rdquo; in its attacks, so if someone does use ZAP to attack your site then this should be apparent in your web server logs.</description>

      <description>If ZAP fails to detect a known problem then please let us know!
Obviously the more information you can give us the better, and the best option would be a simple one page &amp;lsquo;proof of concept&amp;rsquo; in the form of a wavsep test - we can then include those in our regression tests.</description>

      <guid>/faq/why-can-zap-scans-be-inconsistent/</guid>
      <description>If you run ZAP multiple times against a target then you may well find that the results are subtly different even though the target has not changed.
This is not unusual, and we do not consider this a significant problem.
In our experience it is usually all down to how the application is explored - the traditional and ajax spiders seem to be sensitive to small changes, including things like network speed.</description>

      <description>ZAP has no problems scanning applications running on localhost, however there are a couple of things you need to be aware of.
By default ZAP listens on port 8080. If your app also listens on 8080 then you&amp;rsquo;ll need to change one of them to listen on a different port - it&amp;rsquo;s probably easier to change ZAP using the Options Local Proxies screen, remember to change your browser&amp;rsquo;s proxy settings as well: Configuring Proxies.</description>

      <description>The ZAP command line allows you to set individual values as follows:
-config api.key=12345 -config connection.timeoutInSecs=60 How can you find out what keys to use to set the values you want?
The keys are a dot notation of the XML used in the config.xml file.
One way to find out which value you need to change is:</description>

      <description>First of all try checking the &amp;lsquo;Enable unsafe SSL/TLS renegotiation&amp;rsquo; checkbox in the Certificate Options screen and trying again.
Second check if you&amp;rsquo;ve enabled SSLv2Hello in the outbound connection options. If so, disable SSLv2Hello and reload the content to see if the issue is resolved.
If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t help and an HTTPS site reports a handshake failure then try installing the &amp;lsquo;Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files&amp;rsquo;:</description>

      <guid>/faq/what-options-exist-for-selective-proxying/</guid>
      <description>There are a number of ways to accomplish selective proxying.
1 - Via a Browser Add-on/Extension Such as FoxyProxy: https://getfoxyproxy.org/ 2 - Via Global Excludes Leveraging Global Excludes you can specify URLs that ZAP should not intercept. 3 - Via a PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) File You can create your own PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) file and dynamically set proxying as you need, then point your browser at it on your harddrive using the file:/// scheme.</description>

      <guid>/faq/why-cant-zap-connect-to-my-website/</guid>
      <description>This is usually not a ZAP problem.
Is your web application actually running?
Can you connect to it using the IP address rather than the FQDN or hostname?
Can you connect to your application from the same machine using another tool like curl?
If you are using one of the ZAP Docker images then be aware that using Docker will change the networking.</description>

The following suggestions may let you work past the issue.
Try starting ZAP from the command line instead of starting it from a shortcut (such as a Plasma/KDE button, dock icon, etc.) Try adding the following to /etc/environment: _JAVA_OPTIONS=&#39;-Dawt.</description>

      <description>If ZAP is displayed in a really tiny window then it&amp;rsquo;s probably because you have a high DPI display.
We believe High DPI displays and ZAP should behave properly with Windows and Java 11+.

      <description>You can use ZAP to perform security regression tests on your own products.
Note that this answer is very basic and WILL need to be improved ;)
You need to have installed Java and ZAP.
To launch ZAP from a Java program you can do something like:

      <description>ZAP understands API formats like JSON and XML and so can be used to scan APIs.
The problem is usually how to effectively explore the APIs.
There are various options:
If your API has an OpenAPI/Swagger definition then you can import it using the OpenAPI add-on. If your API uses GraphQL then you can explore it using the GraphQL add-on.</description>

      <description>Certificate pinning also known as Public Key Pinning &amp;ldquo;is a mechanism for sites to specify which certificate authorities have issued valid certs for that site, and for user-agents to reject TLS connections to those sites if the certificate is not issued by a known-good CA.&amp;rdquo;
Sites that use certificate pinning will typically not be loaded in your browser if you are proxying it through ZAP.</description>

      <description>The information in this FAQ is based on details from: This user group thread
The Vaadin framework makes heavy use of JavaScript, so it seems the Ajax Spider is the way to go.
As you work to figure things out and get them configured correctly it makes sense to starting by proxying your browser through ZAP, identifying the http session and then flagging it as the &amp;lsquo;active session&amp;rsquo; before starting the Ajax Spider.</description>
