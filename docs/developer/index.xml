      <description>Code Formatting The ZAP code must conform to standard formatting rules - if any changes do not conform then they will fail the build.
Fortunately you do not have to worry about these too much - just run the task: ./gradlew spotlessApply.
Linting While not currently mandatory, we do recommend running SonarLint against any changes you make and fixing anything that it reports.</description>

      <title>ZAP Session Database</title>

      <description>ZAP stores its session data in an HSQLDB file database. There is also experimental support for other database engines.
Connecting to a Session Database Since ZAP locks its session file, it is only possible to view or modify the database when ZAP doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the session open. Session files are usually stored under session/ in the default directory.</description>

      <title>Creating a New Add-on in zap-extensions</title>
      <link>/docs/developer/creating-new-addon-in-zap-extensions/</link>

      <guid>/docs/developer/creating-new-addon-in-zap-extensions/</guid>
      <description>ZAP has a plugin architecture and new functionality is implemented via add-ons.
Add-ons can be defined in any repository but most of the ones that the ZAP core team maintains live in zap-extensions. You should use this repository if you are planning on contributing your add-on to the ZAP project, but please talk to the ZAP Core team about this first via the ZAP Developer Group.</description>

      <title>Development Rules and Guidelines</title>

      <guid>/docs/developer/dev-rules-and-guidelines/</guid>
      <description>This may look like a long list of rules but hopefully many of them are just good development practice.
If you are just getting started with ZAP development then do not worry to much about them, but if you plan to make bigger contributions then you should check them before making too many changes that you might need to rework.</description>
