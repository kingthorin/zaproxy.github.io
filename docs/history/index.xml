      <description>Iâ€™ve always had side projects but at that time I had never contributed to open source. I decided it was a good time to start contributing, so I looked around for an open source security tool with an active community.
Unfortunately I couldnâ€™t find one.
OWASP had WebScarab, but I didnâ€™t really get on with that, and in any case development on that seemed to have stopped.</description>

      <title>ZAP History: 2009 - The Pentest</title>

      <description>In 2009 I was a Java developer / team leader and led a small team which developed an online service for a major accounting software company.
As this service was considered to be security critical I insisted that an external pentest team was hired to ensure the software was suitably secure.</description>

      <description>While I was still finalising the first ZAP release someone else beat me to it ðŸ˜Ÿ.
After years of being neglected, Paros was also forked by Axel Neumann who called his version AndiParos.
I&amp;rsquo;ll have to admit that I was very disheartened and seriously considered abandoning my plans for ZAP.</description>

      <title>ZAP History: 2010 - Why the Name ZAP?</title>

      <description>I find naming things hard. It is easier if the tool has a very specific purpose, but ZAP has lots of uses.
When I was a developer I always wrote command line scripts. If I thought I might need them again then I would call them something sensible, something that would help me find them again.</description>
