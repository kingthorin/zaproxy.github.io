      <description>These were the alerts most frequently flagged as false positives using Alert Filters last month.&#xA;Note that this does not necessarily mean they are false positives, it could mean that the people using ZAP are not interested in these specific vulnerabilities.&#xA;Position Alert Status Rule Type 1 Information Disclosure - Suspicious Comments release Passive 2 Cross-Domain Misconfiguration release Passive 3 X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing release Passive 4 Session ID in URL Rewrite release Passive 5 Timestamp Disclosure release Passive 6 Retrieved from Cache release Passive 7 Strict-Transport-Security Header release Passive 8 User Agent Fuzzer release Active 9 Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set release Passive 10 Re-examine Cache-control Directives release Passive 11 Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens release Passive 12 Cross-Domain JavaScript Source File Inclusion release Passive 13 Cookie without SameSite Attribute release Passive 14 Anti-clickjacking Header release Passive 15 Loosely Scoped Cookie release Passive 16 Modern Web Application release Passive 17 CSP release Passive 18 HTTP Server Response Header release Passive 19 Cookie No HttpOnly Flag release Passive 20 Sub Resource Integrity Attribute Missing beta Passive </description>

      <description>Some stats are shown for all pings and for desktop only pings. The desktop pings show a significantly different profile, possibly because many automated ZAP scans run in the cloud and many cloud providers are located in the USA. We also know that quite a few companies run ZAP as a SaaS offering which will also skew the stats.</description>
