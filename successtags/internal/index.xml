      <description>At OBS, we strive continually to bring our customers peace of mind with strengthened and reinforced application security.
As part of automating our web application and API security, we chose to deploy OWASP ZAP as one of our Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) technologies. This DevSecOps approach helps our developers and engineering teams to detect vulnerabilities, including the OWASP Top Ten Web and API, in CI/CD pipelines before releasing our solutions.</description>

      <description>At Banzai Cloud we use our dast-operator which leverages OWASP ZAP to run baseline scans against the services we deploy on the K8S cluster. This operator deploys OWASP ZAP to the K8S cluster and initiates automated security testing for web applications and APIs based on OpenAPI definitions. Besides the operator responsible for starting the scan against a service, it can prevent opening a vulnerable service to outside.</description>

Similarly, these best practices can be found in another OWASP project, the Software Assurance Maturity Model. We build our software development approach on the OWASP SAMM, to ensure delivery of secure products, from architecture design to the deployment in our own or customerâ€™s infrastructure.</description>
