      <title>Introducing the GraphQL Add-on for ZAP</title>

      <description>GraphQL Schemas can be very large and testing them can be a very time-consuming process. Currently, there is a lack of tools that allow developers to launch and automate attacks on these endpoints. The GraphQL add-on for ZAP intends to fill this gap.
The add-on is still in an early stage, so the range of its functionality is limited.</description>

      <description>We are getting close to releasing the next major version of ZAP.
As there are so many changes we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go to version 2.0.0 rather than 1.5, and some of the biggest changes have come about thanks to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
This is the first year in which ZAP has taken part in the GSoC, and it has been a resounding success.</description>
