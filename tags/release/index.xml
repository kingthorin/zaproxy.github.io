      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with the question of ZAP releases.
We&amp;rsquo;ve made loads of enhancements to ZAP recently, and I want them to be available to as wide an audience as possible.
But I also want to make sure our &amp;lsquo;full&amp;rsquo; releases remain as robust and stable as possible.</description>
