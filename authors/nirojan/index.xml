      <description>ZAP full scan GitHub action provides free dynamic application security testing (DAST) of your web applications. DAST is also known as black-box testing, which allows ZAP to identify potential vulnerabilities in your web applications. We previously introduced the ZAP baseline scan GitHub action to passively identify potential alerts in a web application.</description>

      <description>With the increasing number of web application security breaches, it is essential to keep your web application secure at all times. Furthermore having security integrated into your CI/CD pipeline (DevSecOps) will become a lifesaver if you are actively developing the application. To cater to this need ZAP provides a baseline scan feature to find common security faults in a web application without doing any active attacks.</description>
